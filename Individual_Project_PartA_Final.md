# Introduction:
- GDP(Gross Domestic Product) represents the total monetary value of a country in a period of time. A country’s growth is usually calculated by this factor. Higher the GDP, the higher the National Income. In this rapidly growing world, Technology is something that is playing an important role in representing countries.

**GDP Per Capita of different countries:**
- GDP Per Capita is a measurement of the GDP per person in a country’s population. It indicates that the amount of output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards.

- The above Pi chart shows us the GDP of different countries in the year 2015 with United Arab Emirates having the highest GDP of 28.3% and India the lowest with 2.39%.

- But when we compare the population of these countries China is leading the table whereas the United Arab Emirates is the lowest. This shows us that population also plays a key factor in the growth of GDP.
- This shows us that a country should work according to the population in order to maintain its GDP at the top. The above graph shows that China despite being the most populated country its GDP is quite manageable when compared to other countries.

# Effect of  Science& Technology on GDP:

As mentioned earlier GDP is calculated with the countries economy. This means if any country spends on the development of the technology it would rather develop the GDP as well.
- Spending on technology would help in the raise of the below factors:
  - **Workforce Transformation**: This means outsourcing the work with some companies which would help in the development of small businesses which would rather directly help in the growth of the country’s GDP.
  - **Investment in Startups**: If a country spends some money on developing and implementing the ideas of startups to a larger extent the technology would rise and would help in GDP growth.
  - **Research & Development**: If a product is deployed for the consumer’s use which is developed by a country and being exported to different countries. It would play a vital role in the growth of the GDP of that country.

- The above Bar graph shows us how different countries are spending on Research and Development. This shows that the United States is spending the most on Research.
- China is one of the leading countries in technology which has the advancement of technology for the next 5 years. China also equally give importance to R&D for its GDP growth.
- India being the lowest among all the selected countries, still spends a lot on Research on technology which makes India contributing 2% of the world’s GDP.

# High Technology Exports affecting GDP:

- For example, Apple designs and manufactures its phones in the United States and also has a huge consumer base in Asian countries like India. This shows how Apple is contributing to the GDP of the United States.
- China is the leading country in exporting manufactured technology goods to different countries. The above graph clearly indicates how China is rapidly increasing its export quality goods to different countries.
- When compared to exporting goods the United Kingdom lies second from the top with 23% of manufactured exports whereas the United Arab Emirates lies the lowest in exporting manufactured goods to different countries.
- Although the United Arab Emirates has a higher GDP when compared to other countries because of its less population and advancement in its technology.


# Scientific and Technical Journal Articles:

_ Based on the Journal Articles shows that China and the United States are both leading the competition with about 400k articles.
- So, this shows how every country is contributing towards its economical growth in publishing journal articles.

# Conclusion:

From the observations made by the above graphs and articles, we can conclude that Advancement in Science and Technolgy will help in developing countries economy and GDP. Every country should know that Technological development is an important factor in increasing the growth rate of the economy. However, it also enhances social wealth on the one hand by increasing the income levels and wealth and causes certain social problems on the other hand.

At this point, we must emphasize the importance of technology and make a great contribution to increasing the GDP.
